## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3* were used in creating this project. There's no need to install libraries for running the code in this project beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this Udacity Data Science final project, I used demographics data for customer mail-order sales company in Germany provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. The main goal of the project is to identify the target customer using unsupervised and supervised learning methods. 

The main parts of the project:

1. Customer segmentation by using unsupervised learning methods to identify the main parts of the population that fit the main customer base of the company.
2. Prediction of the response to the mail order campaign by using supervised learning methods.
3. Kaggle Competition. Test the model by submitting the result to Kaggle competition. 
 
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1.	Arvato Project Workbook: The main notebook which includes showcases of the three steps mentioned above, as well as the data exploration, cleaning and visualisation process. Both markdown cells and # were used in the code to help walk through the processes of individual steps.
2.	DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx: Top level list of attributes and descriptions.
3.	DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx: Detailed Mapping of the data values of each attribute. 
4.	Submission.csv: The result for the Kaggle Competition.
